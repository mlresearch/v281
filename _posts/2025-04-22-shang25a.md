title: An Effective Transformer-based Solution for RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection
  Competition
abstract: 'We propose an effective method for the detection of intracranial hemorrhages
  (IHD) that exceeds the performance of the winning solution in the RSNA-IHD competition
  (2019)(Anouk Stein et al. 2019). Meanwhile, our model only takes quarter parameters
  and ten percent FLOPs compared to the winner’s solution. The IHD task must predict
  the hemorrhage category of each slice for the input brain CT. We review the top
  five solutions for the IHD competition held by the Radiological Society of North
  America(RSNA) in 2019. Almost all the top solutions rely on 2D convolutional networks
  and sequential models (Bidirectional GRU or LSTM) to extract intraslice and interslice
  features, respectively. All the top solutions improve performance by using the ensemble
  of models, and the number of models varies from 7 to 31. In the past years, since
  much progress has been made in the computer vision regime especially Transformer-based
  models, we introduce the Transformer-based techniques to extract the features in
  both intra-slice and inter-slice views for IHD tasks. Additionally, a semi-supervised
  method is embedded into our workflow to further improve the performance. The code
  is already available online. Code — https: //github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/CV.
