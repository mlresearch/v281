title: 'ReXrank: A Public Leaderboard for AI-Powered Radiology Report Generation'
abstract: AI-driven models have demonstrated significant potential in automating radiology
  report generation for chest X-rays. However, there is no standardized benchmark
  for objectively evaluating their performance. To address this, we present ReXrank,
  a public leaderboard and challenge for assessing AI-powered radiology report generation.
  Our framework incorporates ReXGradient, the largest test dataset consisting of 10,000
  studies, and three public datasets (MIMIC-CXR, IU-Xray, CheXpert Plus) for report
  generation assessment. ReXrank employs 8 evaluation metrics and separately assesses
  models capable of generating only findings sections and those providing both findings
  and impressions sections. By providing this standardized evaluation framework, ReXrank
  enables meaningful comparisons of model performance and offers crucial insights
  into their robustness across diverse clinical settings. Beyond its current focus
  on chest X-rays, ReXrank’s framework sets the stage for comprehensive evaluation
  of automated reporting across the full spectrum of medical imaging.
