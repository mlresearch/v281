title: 'DK-BEHRT: Teaching Language Models International Classification of Disease
  (ICD) Codes using Known Disease Descriptions'
abstract: The widespread digitization of healthcare and patient data has created new
  opportunities to explore machine learning techniques for improving patient care.
  The sheer scale of this data has particularly motivated the use of deep learning
  methods like BERT, which can learn robust representations of medical concepts from
  patient data without the need for direct supervision. Simultaneously, recent research
  has shown that language models (LMs) trained on scientific literature can capture
  strong domain-specific knowledge, including concepts highly relevant to healthcare.
  In this paper, we leverage two complementary sources of information—patient medical
  records and descriptive clinical text—to learn complex clinical concepts, such as
  diagnostic codes, more effectively. Although significant strides have been made
  in using language models with each data type individually, few studies have explored
  whether the domain expertise acquired from scientific text can provide a beneficial
  inductive bias when applied to learning from patient records. To address this gap,
  we propose the Domain Knowledge BEHRT (DK-BEHRT), a model that integrates disease
  description embeddings from domain-specific language models, like BioGPT, into the
  attention mechanisms of a BERT-based architecture. By incorporating these “knowledge”
  embeddings, we aim to enhance the model’s ability to understand the clinical concept
  (e.g. ICD Codes) more effectively and predict clinical outcomes with higher accuracy.
  We validate this approach on the MIMIC-IV dataset and find that incorporating specialized
  embeddings consistently improves predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes compared
  to using generic embeddings or training the base model from scratch.
