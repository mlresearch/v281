title: An Explainable AI-Integrated Diagnostic System for Voice Analysis in Heart
  Failure Patients
abstract: 'Integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence to analyse voice characteristics
  is an essential topic for future research. We explore the utility of tree-based
  machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, in distinguishing
  between two groups: 100 participants with heart failure and 100 healthy controls.
  The acoustic features extracted from sustained vowel recordings are used to differentiate
  between the two groups. The evaluation shows that the Random Forest model performs
  better, especially with the vowel /i/, achieving Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and
  F1 score over 0.80. We investigate the interpretability of these models usingSHapleyAdditiveexPlanationsvalues,whichrevealthe
  essential acoustic features that influence model predictions and provide insights
  into their clinical relevance. This research highlights the potential of interpretable
  vocal biomarkers in remote monitoring and diagnosing heart failure.'
