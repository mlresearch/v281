title: Improving AI Interpretability for Multilingual Parkinson’s Disease Classification
  through Voice Analysis
abstract: Addressing the imperative need for interpretability in medical models based
  on machine learning and artificial intelligence, our study focuses on the crucial
  task of Parkinson’s disease detection. In this paper, we introduce a vision transformer
  incorporating multilingual vowel phonations, achieving a classification accuracy
  of 89%. To enrich the input representation for vision transformer, we utilized images
  of melspectrograms and regular spectrograms. The success of our model goes beyond
  performance metrics, as we strategically integrate explainable artificial intelligence
  techniques. The synergy between robust classification results and explainability
  underscores the effectiveness of our approach in opening the black-box nature of
  neural networks. This, in turn, contributes to enhanced medical decision-making
  and reinforces the potential of artificial intelligence in advancing diagnostic
  methodologies for Parkinson’s disease.
