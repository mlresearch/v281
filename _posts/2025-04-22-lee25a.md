title: Using Foundation Models to Prescribe Patients Proper Antibiotics
abstract: The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a significant global
  health threat by reducing the effectiveness of essential treatments. This study
  evaluates the potential of clinical decision support systems powered by biomedical
  language foundation models to enhance antibiotic stewardship using electronic health
  records (EHRs). We test several state-of-the-art models, focusing on predicting
  whether each of eight different antibiotics will be effective for an individual
  patient. Additionally, we emphasize interpretability, aiming to understand how the
  models make decisions, where they excel, and where they fall short. Unlike previous
  research, which primarily benchmarks accuracy metrics, we provide insights into
  both the successes and limitations of these models, offering clinical and non-clinical
  experts a clearer understanding of their current state and reliability. These findings
  highlight the potential of AI systems to combat this global health threat, as well
  as the need for further improvements to address the limitations of existing models.
  We hope this work offers valuable guidance for improving AI-driven decision support
  systems and leveraging these advanced models for other clinical applications. Code
