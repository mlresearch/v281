title: 'KG4Diagnosis: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent LLM Framework with Knowledge Graph
  Enhancement for Medical Diagnosis'
abstract: 'Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare diagnosis demands
  systematic frameworks that can handle complex medical scenarios while maintaining
  specialized expertise. We present KG4Diagnosis, a novel hierarchical multi-agent
  framework that combines LLMs with automated knowledge graph construction, encompassing
  362 common diseases across medical specialties. Our framework mirrors real-world
  medical systems through a two-tier architecture: a general practitioner (GP) agent
  for initial assessment and triage, coordinating with specialized agents for in-depth
  diagnosis in specific domains. The core innovation lies in our end-to-end knowledge
  graph generation methodology, incorporating: (1) semantic-driven entity and relation
  extraction optimized for medical terminology, (2) multi-dimensional decision relationship
  reconstruction from unstructured medical texts, and (3) human-guided reasoning for
  knowledge expansion. KG4Diagnosis serves as an extensible foundation for specialized
  medical diagnosis systems, with capabilities to incorporate new diseases and medical
  knowledge. The frameworkâ€™s modular design enables seamless integration of domain-specific
  enhancements, making it valuable for developing targeted medical diagnosis systems.
  We provide architectural guidelines and protocols to facilitate adoption across
  medical contexts.'
