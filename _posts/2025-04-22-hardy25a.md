title: 'ReXTrust: A Model for Fine-Grained Hallucination Detection in AI-Generated
  Radiology Reports'
abstract: The increasing adoption of AI-generated radiology reports necessitates robust
  methods for detecting hallucinationsâ€”false or unfounded statements that could impact
  patient care. We present ReXTrust, a novel framework for fine-grained hallucination
  detection in AI-generated radiology reports. Our approach leverages sequences of
  hidden states from large vision-language models to produce finding-level hallucination
  risk scores. We evaluate ReXTrust on a subset of the MIMIC-CXR dataset and demonstrate
  superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving an AUROC of 0.8751
  across all findings and 0.8963 on clinically significant findings. Our results show
  that white-box approaches leveraging model hidden states can provide reliable hallucination
  detection for medical AI systems, potentially improving the safety and reliability
  of automated radiology reporting.
