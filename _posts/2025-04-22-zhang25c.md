title: 'SegX: Improving Interpretability of Clinical Image Diagnosis with Segmentation-based
  Enhancement'
abstract: Deep learning-based medical image analysis faces a significant barrier due
  to the lack of interpretability. Conventional explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such
  as Grad-CAM and SHAP, often highlight regions outside clinical interests. To address
  this issue, we propose Segmentation-based Explanation (SegX), a plug-and-play approach
  that enhances interpretability by aligning the model’s explanation map with clinically
  relevant areas leveraging the power of segmentation models. Furthermore, we introduce
  Segmentation-based Uncertainty Assessment (SegU), a method to quantify the uncertainty
  of the prediction model by measuring the ’distance’ between interpretation maps
  and clinically significant regions. Our experiments on dermoscopic and chest X-ray
  datasets show that SegX improves interpretability consistently across mortalities,
  and the certainty score provided by SegU reliably reflects the correctness of the
  model’s predictions. Our approach offers a model-agnostic enhancement to medical
  image diagnosis towards reliable and interpretable AI in clinical decision-making.
  The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/JasonZuu/SegX.
