title: 'ColonScopeX: Leveraging Explainable Expert Systems with Multimodal Data for
  Improved Early Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer'
abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related
  deaths and the third most prevalent malignant tumour worldwide. Early detection
  of CRC remains problematic due to its non-specific and often embarrassing symptoms,
  which patients frequently overlook or hesitate to report to clinicians. Crucially,
  the stage at which CRC is diagnosed significantly impacts survivability, with a
  survival rate of 80-95% for Stage I and a stark decline to 10% for Stage IV. Unfortunately,
  in the UK, only 14.4% of cases are diagnosed at the earliest stage (Stage I). In
  this study, we propose ColonScopeX, a machine learning framework utilizing explainable
  AI (XAI) methodologies to enhance the early detection of CRC and pre-cancerous lesions.
  Our approach employs a multimodal model that integrates signals from blood sample
  measurements, processed using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm for fingerprint smoothing,
  alongside comprehensive patient metadata, including medication history, comorbidities,
  age, weight, and BMI. By leveraging XAI techniques, we aim to render the modelâ€™s
  decision-making process transparent and interpretable, thereby fostering greater
  trust and understanding in its predictions. The proposed framework could be utilised
  as a triage tool or a screening tool of the general population. This research highlights
  the potential of combining diverse patient data sources and explainable machine
  learning to tackle critical challenges in medical diagnostics.
