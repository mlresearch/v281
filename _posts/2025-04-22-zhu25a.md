title: 'AAAI Bridge Program 2025: AI for Medicine and Healthcare'
abstract: The AI for Medicine and Healthcare bridge program at AAAI-25 was designed
  to address the critical gap between the rapid advancement of AI technologies and
  their effective integration into clinical practice. While AI has demonstrated significant
  success in medical imaging, diagnostics, and workflow automation, concerns regarding
  explainability, reliability, and clinical usability continue to hinder widespread
  adoption. The bridge program provided an interdisciplinary platform for AI researchers,
  clinicians, and industry experts to collaborate, exchange insights, and discuss
  strategies for developing AI-driven healthcare solutions that align with real-world
  medical needs. The event featured research paper presentations, paper poster sessions,
  and expert panel discussions. This paper provides an in-depth review of the key
  themes, challenges, and future directions that emerged from AI for Medicine and
  Healthcare bridge program at AAAI-25.
