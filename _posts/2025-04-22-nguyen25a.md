title: Evaluating topological fitness of human brain-inspired sub-circuits in Echo
  State Networks
abstract: In recent years, an emerging trend in neuromorphic computing has centered
  around the use of brain connectomics as a blueprint for artificial neural networks.
  Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on embedding human
  brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as estimated from diffusion Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to echo-state networks (ESNs). A critical step
  in ESN embedding requires pre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed
  by the induced subgraphs of the embedded reservoir. As a priori set of functional
  sub-circuits are derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till
  this point, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs
  is well justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance across
  a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and evaluate ESNs
  with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization tasks. To this end,
  we showed that different performance optimums highly depend on the neuro-physiological
  characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced sub-circuits. In general, fMRI-induced
  sub-circuit-embedded ESN outperforms simple bipartite and various null models with
  feed-forward properties commonly seen in MLP for different tasks and reservoir criticality
  conditions. We provided a thorough analysis of the topological properties of pre-determined
  fMRI-induced sub-circuits and highlighted their graph-theoretical properties that
  play significant roles in determining ESN performance. Finally, we demonstrate the
  model’s performance in predicting epidemiological time-series COVID-19 datasets,
  showing the bio-inspired model’s potential in application to public health decision-making.
