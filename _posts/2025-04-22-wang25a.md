title: 'Proactive Pseudo-Intervention: Pre-informed Contrastive Learning For Interpretable
  Vision Models'
abstract: Deep neural networks excel at comprehending complex visual signals, delivering
  on par or even superior performance to that of human experts. However, ad-hoc visual
  explanations of model decisions often reveal an alarming level of reliance on exploiting
  non-causal visual cues that strongly correlate with the target label in training
  data. As such, deep neural nets suffer compromised generalization to novel inputs
  collected from different sources, and the reverse engineering of their decision
  rules offers limited interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we present
  a novel contrastive learning strategy called Proactive Pseudo-Intervention (PPI)
  that leverages proactive interventions to guard against image features with no causal
  relevance. We also devise a novel pre-informed salience mapping module to identify
  key image pixels to intervene and show it greatly facilitates model interpretability.
  To demonstrate the utility of our proposals, we benchmark it on both standard natural
  images and challenging medical image datasets. PPI-enhanced models consistently
  deliver superior performance relative to competing solutions, especially on out-of-domain
  predictions and data integration from heterogeneous sources. Further, saliency maps
  of models that are trained in our PPI framework are more succinct and meaningful.
