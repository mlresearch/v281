title: 'FedStein: Enhancing Multi-Domain Federated Learning Through James-Stein Estimator'
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) facilitates data privacy by enabling collaborative
  in-situ training across decentralized clients. Despite its inherent advantages,
  FL faces significant challenges of performance and convergence when dealing with
  data that is not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). While previous
  research has primarily addressed the issue of skewed label distribution across clients,
  this study focuses on the less explored challenge of multi-domain FL, where client
  data originates from distinct domains with varying feature distributions. We introduce
  a novel method designed to address these challenges â€“ FedStein: Enhancing Multi-Domain
  Federated Learning Through the James-Stein Estimator. FedStein uniquely shares only
  the James-Stein (JS) estimates of batch normalization (BN) statistics across clients,
  while maintaining local BN parameters. The non-BN layer parameters are exchanged
  via standard FL techniques. Extensive experiments conducted across three datasets
  and multiple models demonstrate that FedStein surpasses existing methods such as
  FedAvg and FedBN, with accuracy improvements exceeding 14% in certain domains leading
  to enhanced domain generalization. The code is available at https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedStein'
