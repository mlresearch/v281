title: 'ReXplain: Translating Radiology into Patient-Friendly Video Reports'
abstract: Radiology reports, designed for efficient communication between medical
  experts, often remain incomprehensible to patients. This inaccessibility could potentially
  lead to anxiety, decreased engagement in treatment decisions, and poorer health
  outcomes, undermining patient-centered care. We present ReXplain (Radiology eXplanation),
  an innovative AI-driven system that translates radiology findings into patient-friendly
  video reports. ReXplain uniquely integrates a large language model for medical text
  simplification and text-anatomy association, an image segmentation model for anatomical
  region identification, and an avatar generation tool for engaging interface visualization.
  ReXplain enables producing comprehensive explanations with plain language, highlighted
  imagery, and 3D organ renderings in the form of video reports. To evaluate the utility
  of ReXplain-generated explanations, we conducted two rounds of user feedback collection
  from six board-certified radiologists. The results of this proof-of-concept study
  indicates that ReXplain could accurately deliver radiological information and effectively
  simulate one-on-one consultation, shedding light on enhancing patient-centered radiology
  with potential clinical usage. This work demonstrates a new paradigm in AI-assisted
  medical communication, potentially improving patient engagement and satisfaction
  in radiology care, and opens new avenues for research in multimodal medical communication.
