title: Semi-Supervised Histopathology Image Segmentation with Feature Diversified
  Collaborative Learning
abstract: Histopathology image segmentation plays a critical role in advancing disease
  diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. However, it presents significant challenges
  due to the complexity of tissue structures, staining variability, and low contrast
  between tissue classes. Semi-supervised learning, employed to mitigate annotation
  scarcity, introduces additional difficulties, such as managing noisy pseudo-labels
  while ensuring robust performance with limited supervision. Traditional collaborative
  training methods, commonly used in medical image segmentation, often face issues
  like model coupling—where models become overly dependent on each other, propagating
  similar errors—or confirmation bias, where networks reinforce initial mistakes by
  relying on inaccurate pseudo-labels. Existing frameworks designed to tackle these
  challenges often suffer from complex pipelines and require extensive pre-training
  but fail to address the noise characteristics inherent in such datasets. To balance
  the efficiency of traditional co-training methods with dual networks while enhancing
  segmentation accuracy on noisy histopathological data, we propose Feature Diversified
  Collaborative Learning (FDCL). Our work aims to design an effective feature diversification
  loss that encourages the feature representations of sub-networks to be distinct,
  ensuring they capture different information to exchange with each other, thereby
  avoiding suboptimal solutions or, even worse, falling into the coupling problem.
  We benchmark our method on two well-known histopathology datasets and achieve state-of-the-art
  results on the GlaS dataset with only 10% of the labeled data. Code is available
  at https://github.com/vnlvi2k3/FDCL.
