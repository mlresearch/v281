title: 'MedHallBench: A New Benchmark for Assessing Hallucination in Medical Large
  Language Models'
abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated potential in healthcare
  applications, yet their propensity for hallucinations—generating medically implausible
  or inaccurate information—presents substantial risks to patient care. This paper
  introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and
  mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated
  medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation
  dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines
  automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging)
  scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations, and utilizes reinforcement learning
  methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning
  from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications,
  MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts
  while maintaining stringent accuracy standards.We conducted comparative experiments
  involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely
  adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides
  a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional
  metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research
  establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs reliability in healthcare
  settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge
  of AI hallucinations in medical applications.
