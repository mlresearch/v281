title: Integrating Social Determinants of Health in a Multi-Modal Deep Clustering
  Survival Model for Injury-Risk in Alzheimer’s and Related Dementia Patients
abstract: As our population ages, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
  Dementias (ADRD) and its associated burdens continue to rise. Social Determinants
  of Health (SDOH) significantly influence both ADRD development and progression.
  Using Electronic Health Records (EHR) from a quaternary care academic medical center
  in a diverse urban setting, we investigated SDOH’s impact on multi-modal deep clustering
  survival machines. Our findings revealed that SDOH improved model performance across
  feature selection methods (DeepCox roll-out vs. SHAP DeepExplainer) and EHR clinical
  modalities (medication vs. laboratory). Additionally, Laboratory features proved
  more informative than medications for predicting injury-fall risk. Our results highlight
  SDOH’s crucial role in ADRD progression, particularly regarding injury-fall risk.
  We found that feature importance varied by selection method when analyzing multi-modality
  EHR data, with education emerging as a key SDOH factor among our top 10 features,
  underscoring its significance in ADRD progression.
