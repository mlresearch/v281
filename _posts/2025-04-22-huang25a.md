title: 'RadRevise: A Benchmark Dataset for Instruction-Based Radiology Report Editing'
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist radiologists by making precise edits
  to radiology reports based on human instructions. However, evaluating the quality
  of such modifications has been challenging due to the lack of publicly available
  datasets. To address this gap, we present RadRevise, a novel dataset for assessing
  modelsâ€™ ability to modify radiology reports according to specific instructions.
  RadRevise is derived from the radiology reports in the MIMIC-CXR dataset and includes
  6,402 instructions and 2,922 modified reports. For each report, the dataset includes
  a set of one to five modification instructions, along with the corresponding modified
  output, covering various clinical topics and instruction types. Our benchmarking
  of current open-source models reveals performance gaps in accurately executing these
  instructions, highlighting areas for improvement in AI-assisted report modification.
