title: One-stage Contour Regression Network for Muscle Segmentation
abstract: 'Muscle segmentation from ultrasound images is crucial for diagnosing and
  treating musculoskeletal diseases, as it provides geometric properties, such as
  area and thickness. However, most existing methods often rely on pixel-based segmentation
  networks to extract the muscle region. This is wasteful, inefficient, failing to
  meet the real-time requirements of dynamic analysis. Therefore, to address these
  issues, we introduce a novel One-stage Contour-based Regression network, termed
  as OCRSeg, which formulates the muscle segmentation problem as contour regression
  in the vertical direction. In specific, we achieve this using a regression framework
  that is: 1) simple, consisting of an encoder for feature extraction and an MLP for
  regressing contour coordinates; 2) flexible, enforcing soft total variation constraints
  during training to ensure locally smooth muscle edges; and 3) optimized for band-like
  musculature. Extensive experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our
  method outperforms other state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of accuracy
  and efficiency, achieving over 95.0% in mask IoU score and a FPS over 100 in running
  speed. Furthermore, another key advantage is that OCRSeg can achieve better clinical
  biometrics estimation compared with other techniques. We hope our proposed framework
  can serve as a fundamental and strong baseline for muscle segmentation task.'
