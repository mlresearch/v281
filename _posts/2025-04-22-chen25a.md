title: Unsupervised Patch-GAN with Targeted Patch Ranking for Fine-Grained Novelty
  Detection in Medical Imaging
abstract: Detecting novel anomalies in medical imaging is challenging due to the limited
  availability of labeled data for rare abnormalities, which often display high variability
  and subtlety. This challenge is further compounded when small abnormal regions are
  embedded within larger normal areas, as whole-image predictions frequently overlook
  these subtle deviations. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised Patch-GAN
  framework designed to detect and localize anomalies by capturing both local detail
  and global structure. Our framework first reconstructs masked images to learn fine-grained,
  normal-specific features, allowing for enhanced sensitivity to minor deviations
  from normality. By dividing these reconstructed images into patches and assessing
  the authenticity of each patch, our approach identifies anomalies at a more granular
  level, overcoming the limitations of whole-image evaluation. Additionally, a patch-ranking
  mechanism prioritizes regions with higher abnormal scores, reinforcing the alignment
  between local patch discrepancies and the global image context. Experimental results
  on the ISIC 2016 skin lesion and BraTS 2019 brain tumor datasets validate our frameworkâ€™s
  effectiveness, achieving AUCs of 95.79% and 96.05%, respectively, and outperforming
  three state-of-the-art baselines.
