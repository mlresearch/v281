title: 'Investigating General-Purpose Large Language Models for Patient Information
  Extraction: A Case Study on Real-World Cardiac MRI Reports'
abstract: Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems within healthcare systems contains
  a significant volume of free text written by clinicians in the form of unstructured
  data, meaning access to timely, potential pertinent data signals is precluded. For
  a clinician to analyse information for a cohort of patients for research, information
  extracted from unstructured data needs to be mapped with the routinely collected
  standard structured information and this can require lot of manual work and time.
  This paper studies the potential capabilities of general-purpose Large Language
  Models (LLMs) in the context of, (1) practical deployment using limited CPU computing
  resources, (2) usefulness in the context of extracting patient information within
  healthcare settings and (3) does not require fine-tuning or train models from scratch.
  In particular, we have investigated the utility of prompt-based zero-shot predictions
  by adapting these models in a question answering framework, which is deployed and
  run within a secure on-premise environment with CPU servers for extracting ten years
  of retrospective data containing 15,376 Cardiac MRI reports. Results are evaluated
  on a ground-truth dataset containing 400 randomly selected reports across the ten
  year period with the best performance having an averaged F1-score of 97.83%. Source
  code will be made available upon acceptance.
