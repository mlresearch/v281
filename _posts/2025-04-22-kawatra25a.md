title: 'Minimal Data Maximum Impact: Lessons Learned from Real-World Unstructured
  Data in Paediatric Care'
abstract: Digital health records contains significant volume of pertinent, routine
  information locked within unstructured texts. Current processes requires costly
  human annotation from a limited number of expert annotators with sufficient domain
  knowledge and clinician’s time for verification of the outcomes. Our proposed two-stage
  automated approach enables (1) training and validation of fine-tuned few-shot domain-specific
  models, firstly to retrieve relevant documents and then performing entity recognition
  on the retrieved document chunks for identifying correct span of texts based on
  the use case at hand and, (2) a ”shadow deployment” pipeline testing an end-to-end
  solution in a pre-production environment. Our shadow deployment pipeline uses Large
  Language Models (LLMs) as an explainer-in-the-loop and Natural Language Inference
  (NLI) based verification approach to reduce the dependency on having a clinician
  to validate the outcomes of the solution. In this paper, we describe the experiments
  and results of deploying and testing our proposed approach within a real-world paediatric
  healthcare setting with a focus on histopathology reports of tumours, that can help
  answer clinical questions in a timely manner.
